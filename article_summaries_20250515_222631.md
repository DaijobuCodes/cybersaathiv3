### Summary

Here is a 3-4 concise paragraphs summarizing the article:

Amazon has been testing warehouse robots called "Stow" and "Pick" as part of its expansion into automation. The company claims these robots can pick and stow products with high accuracy, but research papers indicate that humans are still better suited for tasks in warehouses.

In a test, the "Stow" robot was able to move over 500,000 items during a six-month trial period, achieving human levels of packing density and speed. However, it made only about 85% of its picks correctly. The company notes that the robots prioritized work on overhead shelves to ensure safety while humans worked alongside them.

In contrast, "Pick" robot achieved an impressive success rate of over 91%, completing pick requests with high accuracy even when machine vision couldn't identify the items or refuse tasks due to concerns about damage. However, the robot also rejected a significant portion (19.4%) of pick requests due to safety concerns.

Despite these promising results, Amazon emphasizes that humans are still needed in warehouses for tasks like quality control and handling fragile items. The company concludes by encouraging collaboration between humans and robots to push the boundaries of robotic manipulation in industrial settings.

### Summary

Here is a concise summary of the article:

A study conducted by Duke University, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has found that using artificial intelligence (AI) at work can harm an individual's professional reputation. The study involved over 4,400 participants who used AI tools such as ChatGPT or Claude for work-related tasks. Despite these productivity-enhancing benefits, the study revealed a consistent pattern of bias against those who use AI for work, with individuals facing negative judgments about their competence and motivation from others.

The researchers argue that social perceptions play a significant role in reducing the acceptance of helpful technologies like AI at work. If others perceive you as using AI because you are incompetent or lazy, they may be more likely to conceal your use in professional settings. This can create a paradox where productivity-enhancing AI tools can simultaneously improve performance and damage one's professional reputation.

The study's findings suggest that social evaluation penalties may be an overlooked barrier to AI adoption, highlighting the importance of considering how individuals perceive technology at work. A recent Danish study found that generative AI chatbots have had almost no impact on salaries or jobs thus far, which challenges existing narratives of imminent labor market transformation due to AI.

Overall, the study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the social implications of using AI at work and the importance of considering how individuals perceive technology in their professional settings.
