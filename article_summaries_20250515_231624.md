### Summary

Here's a concise summary of the article:

Amazon has successfully tested warehouse robots, called "Stow" and "Pick", which can perform tasks such as picking products from storage pods and sending them for packaging. While the robots show promise, human workers are still essential in many aspects of Amazon's operations.

Key points:

* Amazon has been testing Stow and Pick robot systems to improve efficiency in warehouse sorting.
* The robots achieve high packing density and speed while prioritizing work on overhead shelves.
* In a test, humans stowed 243 units per hour during March 2025, while the robots only stowed at 224 UPH.

Important details:

* Amazon's testing revealed that human workers can still perform tasks with high accuracy, but they are not yet fully automated out of necessity.
* The Stow robot achieved an average packing success rate of around 85%, which is higher than expected.
* The Pick robot showed a much higher success rate, with 91% accuracy across 12,000 pick attempts.

Security implications:

* Amazon's use of robots in warehouses raises concerns about job displacement and the potential for increased security risks.
* As humans are still needed to perform certain tasks, there is a need for ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of automation solutions.

### Summary

Here is a 3-4 paragraph summary of the article:

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that using artificial intelligence (AI) at work can have negative effects on an employee's professional reputation. The study, which involved over 4,400 participants, revealed a consistent pattern of bias against those who use AI tools for work. Individuals who use AI face negative judgments about their competence and motivation from others, leading to social stigma.

The study points out that using AI can be seen as "competent but lazy" or "unmotivated," which can lead to concealment of AI use in professional settings. This paradox highlights how social perceptions may reduce the acceptance of helpful technologies like AI in the workplace. The authors believe that scholars have focused primarily on the perceived characteristics of the technology itself, rather than its social implications.

The study's findings are an important consideration for organizations considering the adoption of AI at work. While AI can be a productivity-enhancing tool, its use may still be met with skepticism and social evaluation, potentially reducing its effectiveness in terms of professional reputation. The study's results challenge the idea that AI will automatically lead to significant labor market transformation.

The study also notes that there is limited research on the social evaluation consequences of AI use, which highlights a potential oversight. Future studies should investigate how individuals perceive the technology they are using and whether concealment or avoidance of their AI use in professional settings can impact its overall performance.
