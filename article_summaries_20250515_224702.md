### Summary

Here is a concise summary of the article in 3-4 paragraphs:

Amazon has been testing warehouse robots called "Stow" and "Pick", which can pick and stow products in warehouses. The company claims these robots have achieved human levels of packing density and speed while prioritizing work on overhead shelves to enhance safety. In a research paper, Amazon stated that the "Stow" robot successfully moved over 500,000 items during a test, achieving about 85% success rate.

However, when it came to testing the "Pick" robot in a real-world setting, Amazon found that humans were still better at tasks. The company reported an average of 243 units per hour stowed by humans versus 224 units per hour stowed by robots during a month-long trial deployment in March 2025. Additionally, the "Pick" robot rejected about 19% of pick requests due to machine vision issues or concerns for item damage.

Despite these results, Amazon is optimistic that its warehouse robots can replace human workers. The company states that sharing its experiences and insights will encourage collaborative efforts pushing the boundaries of robotic manipulation in industrial settings. Amazon's tests suggest that robots may be able to handle complex tasks like picking targeted objects from cluttered shelves, but humans are still needed for certain aspects of the process.

The article highlights two key points: (1) warehouse robots can perform tasks such as packing and stowing with high success rates, while (2) human workers remain essential for specific tasks that require precision or delicate handling. Amazon's focus on sharing its experiences will likely encourage other companies to adopt similar approaches in their own warehouses.

### Summary

**Using AI at Work: A Study Finds Potential Barriers to Adoption**

A new study conducted by Duke University has found that using artificial intelligence (AI) tools can damage an employee's professional reputation, highlighting potential social stigma. Over 4,400 participants were enrolled in the study "Evidence of a Social Evaluation Penalty for Using AI," which revealed a consistent pattern of bias against those who use AI.

The findings show that individuals who use AI tools face negative judgments about their competence and motivation from others, manifesting as both anticipated and actual social penalties. This paradox arises when productivity-enhancing AI tools can simultaneously improve performance and damage one's professional reputation. The study suggests that this barrier to adoption is more significant than previously thought.

The researchers also found that if others perceive the use of AI as a sign of incompetence or laziness, employees may actively conceal their use in professional settings. This self-preservation mechanism may be driven by individuals' existing perceptions of themselves and their work performance. The study emphasizes the importance of considering social evaluation consequences when evaluating the adoption of AI technologies.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Using AI tools can damage an employee's professional reputation, despite productivity-enhancing effects.
* Social stigma associated with AI use can lead to negative judgments about competence and motivation from others.
* The paradox between positive performance gains and social penalties highlights potential barriers to AI adoption.

**Important Technical Details:**

* Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini have had almost no impact on salaries and jobs so far, according to a study in Denmark.
* A study by Duke University found that individuals who use AI tools face negative judgments about their competence and motivation from others.
