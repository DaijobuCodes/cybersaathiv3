### Key Security Issue

A recent study found that using artificial intelligence (AI) at work can have negative effects on an employee's professional reputation, as individuals who use AI are perceived as 'competent but lazy' or 'unmotivated', leading to social stigma.

### DO's

✅ Implement transparent and open communication channels with colleagues to discuss the benefits and challenges of using AI tools in your team.

✅ Develop a clear policy on AI use that outlines acceptable and unacceptable behavior, and make sure it's communicated to all employees.

✅ Conduct regular feedback sessions with managers and peers to address any concerns or biases they may have about AI use among colleagues.

### DON'Ts

❌ Avoid using AI tools as a substitute for human judgment or critical thinking in decision-making processes.

❌ Don't make assumptions about an employee's competence or motivation based on their ability to use AI, and provide support and resources to help them get the most out of these tools.

❌ Don't use AI as a way to hide or conceal your own work, as this can lead to social stigma and negative judgments from colleagues.

### Key Security Issue

To defend against Scattered Spider's latest TTPs (Threats To Protect), users must ensure their networks are segmented and isolated.

### DO's

✅ {"Network segmentation is critical to prevent Scattered Spider's attacks. Implement a multi-tiered network architecture with separate segments for each business unit."

✅ "Use DNS filtering to block known malicious IP addresses and reduce the attack surface."

✅ {"Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Monitor WAF logs regularly."

✅ "Keep your operating systems, applications, and software up to date with the latest security patches. Scattered Spider's exploits often target known vulnerabilities."

✅ "Use encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data. Ensure all devices, including laptops and mobile devices, have robust encryption protocols."

### DON'Ts

❌ {"Avoid using weak or default passwords for any system or service. This makes it easy for Scattered Spider's attackers to gain access."

❌ {"Don't assume that just because you've patched a vulnerability, your entire network is secure. Continuously monitor for new threats and exploits."

❌ {"Don't rely on a single security tool or solution to protect your network. Use multiple solutions and regularly update them to stay ahead of Scattered Spider's attacks."

❌ {"Don't ignore or downplay the threat of social engineering. Scattered Spider's attacks often use psychological manipulation to get users to reveal sensitive information."

❌ "Don't assume that a small patch or fix will prevent all future attacks. Scattered Spider's attacks can be sophisticated and require multiple vectors of attack."
