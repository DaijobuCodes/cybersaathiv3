### Summary

Here's a concise summary of the article:

Amazon has been testing warehouse robots, dubbed "Stow" and "Pick", which are designed to automate tasks such as picking and stowing products. While initial results suggest promising performance, humans remain essential for certain tasks due to their ability to assess available space and prioritize work. In a test, both Stow and Pick systems achieved around 85% success rates in packing approximately 500,000 items, with Pick reaching 91%. However, the robots rejected up to 19.4% of pick requests when they encountered an item or refused to perform due to concern for damage.

The key points from this article include:

* Amazon's warehouse robots, Stow and Pick, have been tested in a real-world deployment, but humans are still needed for certain tasks.
* Initial results show promising performance, with both systems achieving around 85% success rates in packing products.
* Pick has achieved the highest success rate, reaching 91%, while Stow has also shown promise.
* The robots rejected up to 19.4% of pick requests when they encountered an item or refused to perform due to concern for damage.

Important technical details and security implications:

* Amazon's warehouse robots feature advanced technologies such as machine vision, precision manipulation, and predictive modeling.
* The systems have been tested in a controlled environment with high volume production data, which suggests that the technology can be scaled up.
* However, the rejection rate of 19.4% highlights potential risks associated with relying on automation for critical tasks.

Overall, this article highlights the ongoing development of warehouse robotics and their increasing capabilities, while also emphasizing the importance of human oversight and task selection in industrial settings.

### Summary

Here is a 3-4 concise paragraph summary of the article:

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that using artificial intelligence (AI) at work can harm an employee's professional reputation, according to Duke University. The study, which surveyed over 4,400 participants, revealed a consistent pattern of bias against those who use AI tools for work, with individuals facing negative judgments about their competence and motivation from others.

The findings suggest that using AI tools can create a paradox where productivity-enhancing technologies can simultaneously improve performance and damage one's professional reputation. This is due to the social evaluation penalty created by others when they discover that an individual is using AI tools. As a result, employees may feel pressured to conceal their use of AI in professional settings.

The study highlights an important oversight in previous research on AI adoption, which has focused primarily on how technology itself is perceived rather than its social consequences. The researchers propose that the social evaluation penalty is a significant barrier to AI adoption and challenge existing narratives about the imminent impact of generative AI on labor markets.

The study's findings have implications for industries where AI is being adopted, including education, healthcare, and finance. As such, organizations should be aware of the potential social consequences of using AI tools and consider how to mitigate these effects through effective communication and training.
