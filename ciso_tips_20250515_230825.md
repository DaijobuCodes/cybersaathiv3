### Key Security Issue

Despite initial enthusiasm, Amazon's warehouse robots struggle with complex operations like sorting items on shelves and handling delicate products.

### DO's

✅ Ensure that all 'Stow' robot users are properly trained on the pinch gripper, extendable plank, visual perception system, and machine learning model before deployment.

✅ Implement a robust quality control process to monitor and test 'Pick' systems for accuracy and safety, even in complex scenarios.

### DON'Ts

❌ Do not disable or remove the 'Pick' system's machine learning model without proper testing and validation to avoid compromising its ability to predict packing success rates.

❌ Don't attempt to optimize 'Stow' robot performance solely through manual adjustments, as this could compromise the pinch gripper or extendable plank's functionality.

❌ Avoid using physical tools or force to manually sort items on shelves, as this may damage products and reduce the robots' effectiveness.

❌ Don't assume that 'Pick' systems will automatically reject rejected pick requests without proper review and oversight by human analysts.

### Key Security Issue

Scattered Spider's latest Threat Transformation (TTPs) involve deploying a custom, highly contagious malware that can spread through scattered web pages and emails, causing widespread network compromise.

### DO's

✅ 'Closely monitor your website's HTTP headers for unusual changes, as Scattered Spider is known to manipulate these headers to evade detection'.

✅ Regularly scan your email attachments with a cloud-based security platform to detect and remove custom malware signatures.

✅ 'Implement a layered security approach by including a web application firewall (WAF) in your network architecture, ensuring that all traffic is inspected and blocked'.

✅ 'Keep your browser and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches, as Scattered Spider's exploits often target known vulnerabilities'.

✅ Test your website's compliance with the Web Application Firewall (WAF) standards to ensure it can block custom malware signatures correctly.

### DON'Ts

❌ 'Avoid using weak passwords or easily guessable credentials for your account, as these can be easily guessed by Scattered Spider's automated tools'.

❌ Never open suspiciously named attachments or click on links from unknown senders, especially if they're related to your website or sensitive information.

❌ 'Don't rely solely on antivirus software; instead, use a cloud-based security platform that integrates with your network and can detect custom malware signatures in real-time'.

❌ 'Avoid using outdated plugins or add-ons, as these can provide an entry point for Scattered Spider's malware to infect your website or system.

❌ 'Don't store sensitive data, such as financial information or personal identifiable information (PII), on your website; instead, use a secure storage solution like encrypted databases'.
