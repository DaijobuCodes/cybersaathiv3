## 1. Amazon touts warehouse robots but humans still better at tasks

### Summary

Here's a concise summary of the article in 3-4 paragraphs:

Amazon has been testing warehouse robots called "Stow" and "Pick" to automate tasks such as picking and stowing products. These robots feature advanced technologies like pinch grippers, extendable planks for manipulation, visual perception systems, and machine learning models to predict packing success rates.

The company's initial tests in research papers showed promising results. The "Stow" robot was able to move over 500,000 items during a test and achieve human-level packing density and speed while prioritizing work on overhead shelves to enhance safety for humans working alongside robots. On the other hand, the "Pick" robot achieved higher success rates, with 91% of pick requests successfully executed.

However, Amazon notes that the difference in performance between the two robots is not necessarily due to their robotic capabilities but rather human workers' ability to handle tasks efficiently and safely. The company's research papers show that humans are still needed to stow products at an average rate of 243 units per hour while the robotic systems do it at around 224 UPH.

Despite these results, Amazon plans to continue testing and refining its warehouse automation solutions with a focus on prioritizing human workers' abilities and safety. The company aims to encourage collaboration between humans and robots to push the boundaries of industrial manipulation in settings like warehouses.

### Summary

Here is a 3-4 paragraph summary of the article, focusing on key points, main insights, and important details:

A recent study by Duke University has found that using artificial intelligence (AI) at work can damage an employee's professional reputation. The study surveyed over 4,400 participants and found that those who use AI tools face negative judgments from others about their competence and motivation. These biases are likely to manifest in both anticipated and actual social penalties.

The study suggests that the paradox of using AI-enhancing tools leading to improved performance but damaging one's professional reputation is not limited to productivity alone. Social perceptions can also hinder the acceptance of helpful technologies, such as those found in Denmark's generative AI chatbots (ChatGPT or Gemini). These researchers argue that scholars have focused primarily on how technology is perceived, rather than its social evaluation consequences.

The study highlights an important oversight: people may choose not to use AI, or not disclose their use, due to the fear of being judged as less competent or less diligent by others. This social penalty can be particularly problematic for those who are already perceived as incompetent or lazy. To mitigate this issue, researchers propose that future studies should explore the social evaluation consequences of AI use.

The study's findings challenge narratives of imminent labor market transformation due to generative AI and have important implications for how we approach the adoption of AI at work. By understanding the social impacts of AI use, organizations can take steps to minimize potential negative effects on employee perceptions and reputation, ultimately improving the overall effectiveness of AI in the workplace.
